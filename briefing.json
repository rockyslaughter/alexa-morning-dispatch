    "mainText": "**Is War With Iran Imminent?**\nPresident Donald Trump has assured Iranian protesters that help is on the way, but recent events suggest tensions could escalate into conflict. It has been 45 days since Trump's assurance, during which the Iranian regime has suppressed protests, reportedly killing thousands. Meanwhile, the U.S. is bolstering its military presence in the Middle East and Arabian Sea, preparing for possible military action following a failed series of negotiations in Geneva.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. officials met recently to discuss nuclear capabilities and avoiding military conflict, but no breakthroughs occurred. Both sides will consult with their leaders and prepare for further talks. A U.S. official described the discussions as positive, though an agreement remains uncertain due to previous failed negotiations and Iran's potential readiness to challenge U.S. threats.\n\nTrump warned that failure to reach a deal could lead to severe consequences for Iran. Military options being considered range from targeted strikes on Iranian military bases to a broader campaign to undermine the Iranian regime. Analysts indicate a cautious approach is necessary due to the potential for Iranian retaliation against U.S. interests abroad, which could draw the U.S. into deeper conflict.\n\n**Afghanistan and Pakistan Go to War**\nOn Friday, Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif declared open war with Afghanistan after Pakistani warplanes conducted strikes on targets in Kabul, Kandahar, and Paktia province, dubbed Operation Ghazab lil-Haq or “Righteous Fury.” This escalation follows Taliban offensives targeting Pakistani military positions along the Durand Line, the contested border between the countries.\n\nClaims of military success differ significantly: Pakistan alleges it killed 133 Taliban fighters and destroyed 27 posts, while the Taliban asserts only eight of its soldiers died, claiming to have killed 55 Pakistani troops and captured 19 posts. Asif accuses the Taliban of acting as a proxy for India and exporting terrorism. This situation ends a previously established ceasefire after significant violence over the past months.\n\n**Paramount Wins Warner Bros. Fight**\nParamount has placed a bid of $111 billion to acquire Warner Bros., at $31 per share, which is significantly higher than Netflix's previous offer of $83 billion. Netflix will not revise its bid, as its co-CEOs stated that the financial attractiveness of the deal has declined at the new price point. Paramount offered to cover a previously agreed $2.8 billion termination fee should Warner Bros. accept its offer. The Warner Bros. board has yet to terminate their Netflix agreement formally, and Paramount's offer remains unaccepted.\n\n**Mamdani Meets With Trump Again**\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani met with President Trump to discuss housing initiatives and the recent immigration arrest of a Columbia University student, Elmina Aghayeva. Trump assured Mamdani via phone that Aghayeva would be released imminently. The city's government is seeking $21 billion in federal grants to create 12,000 affordable homes, marking a significant infrastructure investment.\n\nFederal immigration officials had arrested Aghayeva earlier in her university apartment, claiming her visa was canceled in 2016 for non-attendance. Mamdani also urged Trump to halt deportation proceedings against four students involved in political activism, including pro-Palestinian protests.\n\n**Ukraine and Iran Talks**\nOn another front, White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held meetings with Iranian and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, focusing on limiting Iran’s nuclear ambitions and potential military conflicts.  A senior U.S. official indicated positivity in the negotiations, despite no agreements being reached yet. The conversations with Ukrainian officials are aimed at preparing terms for future discussions with Russia related to peace talks.\n\n**U.S. Shoots Down Its Own Drone**\nRecent reports detail that the Defense Department mistakenly shot down a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol-operated drone in Texas after employing a high-energy, anti-drone laser system. Reports indicate that coordination issues among federal agencies led to the mishap, which highlights the importance of communication during operational activities in sensitive areas.",
