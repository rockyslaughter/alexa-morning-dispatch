    "mainText": "**Can AI Create Something Entirely New?**\nFebruary 28, 2026\nValerie Pavilonis, Jenna Stocker, Declan Garvey\n\nMuch discussion surrounds AI’s potential impact across business, law, technology, journalism, and various other domains. The spotlight today shines on art. Jenna Stocker argues AI cannot be a true artist, highlighting the stark differences between AI's mechanistic nature and the creativity exemplified by the late Milton Glaser, the designer famed for the \"I Love NY\" slogan.\n\nIn today's findings, writer Sam Buntz sheds light on Chicago's literary landscape, challenging New York City’s title as America’s literary capital. Buntz notes, \"The literary life of Chicago has been defined by the work, rather than the scene,” contending that the city's focus on production establishes it as a plainspoken yet creatively vibrant alternative to New York's renowned status.\n\nAdditionally, Thomas Dichter reflects on his father, Ernest Dichter—forefather of motivation research—criticizing contemporary digital advertising for lacking the spirit and imagination characteristic of the \"Mad Men\" era. He observes, \"Digital ads have become just one more stressor in a hyperspeed era where most of us are overstimulated and over talked-at...\"\n\nStocker continues the dialogue, attributing Glaser's creative success to a uniquely human ability—imbuing work with emotional context that machines simply cannot replicate. AI, she claims, lacks the capacity to create a genuine cultural resonance or intimacy that reflects society’s collective experiences and passions.\n\nReflecting on Glaser's legacy, Stocker emphasizes his art, which played a crucial role in revitalizing New York City during its bleakest days, offering not only a brand but an emotional connection. His conception of “I (Love) NY” drew from human experiences in a way that AI cannot achieve, as it does not possess the lived experiences needed to infuse originality into art or messaging.\n\nIn the exploration of the human condition and imagination, Gaston Bachelard's philosophical treatise, \"La Poétique de l’Espace\", is noted for its insights on how space, molded by imagination, transcends mere physicality—a perspective AI appears incapable of grasping.\n\nStocker captures the essence of creativity through Glaser's renowned collaborations, showcasing his influence on design, music, and culture. The conclusion stresses that while AI presents remarkable capabilities, it is the human spirit that perpetuates creativity and the exploration of the unknown, ensuring art remains a vital aspect of our existence.",
