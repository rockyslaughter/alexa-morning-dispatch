    "mainText": "**News Briefing**\n\nThis week, a colorful review of the new adaptation of *Wuthering Heights* by Nicole Penn critiques director Emerald Fennell for what is perceived as a squandered opportunity at a masterpiece. Penn argues that despite the film's provocative elements, it ultimately fails to engage, stating, \"For all its whips, chains, and back sweat, the most offensive part of Fennell's *Wuthering Heights* isn't that it's transgressive; it's that it's shockingly and undeniably boring.\"\n\nIn another notable piece, Aidan Grogan from Liberty University contends that the primary issue facing Gen Z is spiritual rather than economic. He notes that nearly three-fifths of young adults report feeling a lack of meaning or purpose in their lives. Quoting a psychologist from North Dakota State University, Grogan points out that many Gen Z individuals harbor a belief that \"humans were a mistake,\" suggesting that financial improvement alone will not address their underlying spiritual crises.\n\nFurther, a poignant commentary from Valerie Pavilonis discusses the Dominican artist Firelei Báez and the power of contemporary art in teaching history. Pavilonis reflects on the harrowing legacy of the slave trade, stating, \"The transport of enslaved Africans to the Americas shows what happens when humans dehumanize and mechanize other humans: Torture, death, and a stripping away of human dignity that would make Lucifer laugh. History shows us the bones of all of this; art, on the other hand, adds flesh to those bones.\"\n\nFrom earlier in the week, readers can find insights from Nick Pompella on why New Atheism has faded, Jonah Goldberg's exploration of the concept of 'white culture', and Kevin Williamson's piece on Jesse Jackson.\n\n**American Artifacts**\n\nIn a historical reflection, Chris Stirewalt delves into the cultural significance of chewing tobacco, particularly the Mail Pouch brand from the Bloch Brothers Tobacco Company in Wheeling, West Virginia. He explains the distinctions between chewing tobacco and dip; the former being ribbons of tobacco leaves that foster a particular cultural practice of spitting—a custom deeply ingrained in certain American communities. Stirewalt reminisces about the heyday of chewing tobacco, which was largely eclipsed by cigarettes in the mid-20th century. He recounts the advertising strategy of Mail Pouch, which involved farmers painting their barns to promote the product along highways, creating a nostalgic image that persists, even as modern regulations have limited new barn paintings. Stirewalt concludes with an anecdote about Harley Warrick, the last of the barn painters, who preserved this unique form of advertising until his retirement.\n\n**An Outside Read**\n\nIn cultural analysis, a blog titled *The Muted Trumpet* by writer Sam Buntz captures a moment from Werner Herzog’s documentary *Encounters at the End of the World*, in which a lone penguin ventures toward certain death. Buntz interprets this act as a profound spiritual journey, comparing it to biblical stories of seeking divine encounters, suggesting that the penguin's isolation serves as a metaphor for enlightenment.\n\n**Stuff We Like**\n\nAnna Coulter shares her experience with mouth tape as a practical solution to sleep disturbances. Despite her self-description as no wellness guru, she found that using medical tape to keep her mouth shut while sleeping significantly improved her rest. Coulter humorously suggests this simple remedy could address various sleep-related issues, urging readers to consider the benefits of this inexpensive alternative.\n\n**Work of the Week**\nJohn Lewis showcases *Self-portrait* by Jacopo Pontormo, remarking on the unmatched beauty of Renaissance sketches and the emotional depth in the expressions of Pontormo’s figures.",
