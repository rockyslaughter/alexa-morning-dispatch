    "mainText": "**Why Is Crime Down in America?**\n\n**More Details in the Alex Pretti Shooting**\nThe Department of Homeland Security has released a new report regarding the fatal police shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. The report, sent to congressional members, indicates that a Border Patrol agent and a Customs and Border Protection officer discharged their weapons during the incident on Saturday. It remains unclear if those shots hit Pretti. The report details that a struggle ensued when agents attempted to take Pretti into custody, with one officer reportedly shouting, \"He’s got a gun\" moments before the shooting occurred.\n\nIn response, over 160 House Democrats have introduced an impeachment resolution against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated that if President Donald Trump does not remove Noem, House Democrats will initiate impeachment proceedings against her. Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski have also called for her resignation.\n\n**Safety Board Blames FAA For Plane Crash That Killed 67 People**\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has released findings blaming a series of administrative errors for a tragic plane crash in Washington, D.C., last year that resulted in 67 fatalities. On Tuesday, NTSB officials criticized the Federal Aviation Administration for approving a helicopter’s flightpath that overlapped with routes used by commercial aircraft, stating that this decision introduced unacceptable risks. NTSB Chair Jennifer Hommendy declared this incident \"100 percent preventable.\"\n\nInvestigators further found that the Army failed to properly train the helicopter crew to navigate busy airspace and did not adequately inform pilots of altitude reading inaccuracies. They also flagged other factors impacting the crash, including the air traffic controller's failure to warn pilots and FAA personnel being overworked, along with ignored warnings related to other near-misses.\n\n**Hamas Wants Involvement In Gaza Administration**\nIn the aftermath of the ceasefire deal, Hamas is seeking to integrate 10,000 of its militants into a policing role within Gaza's transitional administration, despite not yet having begun disarmament. Israel has rejected this proposal. A U.S. official mentioned that Hamas's disarmament would come with some form of amnesty. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that the disarmament of Hamas's arsenals and tunnels must occur before any reconstruction in Gaza can commence.\n\n**New Study on Russia-Ukraine Casualties**\nA recent study published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies has estimated that there have been approximately 1.8 million casualties, including killed, injured, and missing persons, in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. This includes around 325,000 Russian fatalities and 140,000 Ukrainian soldier deaths. To replenish its military, Russia has been offering substantial financial bonuses to potential recruits, along with amnesty for prisoners and citizenship to immigrants. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo, after discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping, suggested that China could play a role in encouraging Russia to negotiate a peace deal.\n\n**Today in America**\nA federal district judge has dismissed a Justice Department lawsuit seeking Oregon’s voter rolls.\nThe family members of two Trinidadian men killed in an October airstrike on a suspected drug trafficking boat are suing the Trump administration, claiming the strike lacked legal justification.\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott has directed state agencies and public universities to cease applying for H-1B worker visas.\nA Virginia state judge ruled that state Democratic legislators improperly advanced a proposed amendment for congressional redistricting.\nMinnesota officials have arrested a man who confronted Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar at a town hall, attempting to spray her with an unidentified liquid.\nReports suggest the State Department and CIA plan to establish a permanent presence in Venezuela.",
