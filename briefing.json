    "mainText": "**Weekend Features Overview**\nThis weekend, we delve into non-political discussions. LuElla D’Amico explores how celebrity drama, while seemingly trivial, can illuminate our values for family dynamics. She states, \"These stories let us explore questions about loyalty, forgiveness, boundaries, and respect without naming names at our great uncle’s 75th birthday party. Through someone else’s family drama, we test our own moral instincts.\"\n\n**Modern Families**\nIn the article titled \"Will the Modern Family Break, or Bend?\", D’Amico articulates how emotional wounds in family memories can linger in today’s age.\n\n**Motherhood and Translation**\nNext, Nadya Williams addresses the intersection of motherhood and translation in her new book. She prompts readers with, \"Books can be translated, but can the experience of motherhood?\" Williams reflects on the struggles of understanding maternal experiences through translation.\n\n**Podcast Recommendation**\nMadeleine Lawson reviews the popular TV show *Heated Rivalry*, noting its return to classic romance storytelling. Lawson describes the series: \"Two attractive, talented people who are somehow at odds notice each other’s massive sex appeal and consent to test the waters, risk be damned. The bone structure here is sturdy and recognizable.\"\n\n**Academic Profiles**\nEarlier this week, Pepperdine University professor Jessica Hooten Wilson discussed the Western canon. *Dispatch* Senior Editor Michael Warren contributed a profile on a notable Georgia woman, highlighting her impactful and rabble-rousing presence. Emmett Rensin, a new contributing writer, analyzed the evolving perception of the word \"fascism\" in contemporary society.\n\n**American Artifacts: Edmonia Lewis**\nFeatured this week, Nathan Beacom revisits the life of Edmonia Lewis, a pioneering sculptor born to a free black father and a Native American mother in 1844. After being orphaned, Lewis was supported by family. She pursued her education at Oberlin College, where she faced racial discrimination but found her passion in art. Ultimately, Lewis moved to Rome, where she experienced a more accepting existence as an artist. Notably, one of her acclaimed works, *The Death of Cleopatra*, is displayed at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.\n\n**Literary Reflection**\nIn a reflection on George Washington's response to a letter from poet Phillis Wheatley, it highlights the importance of recognizing the humanity and talent of artists irrespective of their backgrounds.\n\n**Cultural Observations**\nCharlotte Lawson, in her latest observations, offers a quirky look at life in South Florida, where temperatures have recently dipped. Lawson notes the curious phenomenon of iguanas freezing when temperatures drop below fifty degrees. She shares her fascination with the vibrant culture and unusual sights found throughout the region.\n\n**Work of the Week**\nThis week's featured art is *The Price of Blood* by Thomas Satterwhite Noble. John Shelton Reed, a noted member of *The Dispatch*, emphasizes Noble's anti-slavery stance as he portrays a family dynamic in post-Emancipation America, highlighting the emotional complexity surrounding the sale of a mulatto son by a slaveholder.\n\nIn closing, we encourage submissions for future features, inviting readers to share artworks representing diverse voices and perspectives.",
