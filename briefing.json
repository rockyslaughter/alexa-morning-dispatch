    "mainText": "**Trump Says India Will Stop Buying Russian Oil**\nFollowing a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. will lower tariffs on India in exchange for a commitment to halt oil purchases from Russia. Trump stated the reciprocal tariff on Indian imports would go from 25 to 18 percent, with confirmation that the punitive 25 percent tariff for buying Russian oil will also be revoked. Trump claimed that Modi promised to stop purchasing Russian oil and suggested India would instead buy oil from the U.S. and potentially Venezuela. However, Modi's subsequent tweet did not mention Russian oil or Trump’s claims regarding reductions in levies on American goods. Russian crude makes up about a third of India's total oil imports, translating to approximately 1.5 million barrels per day. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted that the Indian government has not communicated any intention to cease purchasing Russian oil.\n- Trump mentioned Modi committed to over $500 billion in U.S. energy and technology purchases.\n- Reports indicated Indian oil imports from Russia were already declining with refiners cutbacks in January.\n- This deal follows India signing a free trade agreement with the European Union a week prior.\n\n**U.S. Talks Iranian Peace Deal**\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and White House special envoy Steve Witkoff are scheduled to meet in Istanbul on Friday to discuss a potential agreement regarding Iran’s nuclear program. Foreign ministers from various regional countries—including Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia—are expected to attend. This meeting follows increased naval deployment by the U.S. in the Persian Gulf. It marks the first official dialogue since the significant conflict between Israel and Iran, which concluded with U.S. strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The U.S. has reportedly set out three main demands: zero uranium enrichment, limits on ballistic missile development, and an end to Iran's support for regional militias.\n- Iranian officials have indicated flexibility regarding uranium enrichment but firmly oppose reducing missile development or militia support.\n- Iran has also requested the withdrawal of U.S. military assets in the area as a precondition for talks.\n- Witkoff will first meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before talks in Istanbul.\n\n**Government Shutdown Talks Continue**\nAs the partial government shutdown extended into this week, the House Rules Committee advanced a funding package along party lines, clearing the way for a potential vote imminently. This plan aims to fund most government operations through September, but it sets Department of Homeland Security funding to expire after February 13 to allow discussions on immigration enforcement reforms. Trump backed this bill, insisting it be passed without amendments. Some Republicans sought to include voter ID requirement legislation, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned this would be a nonstarter in the Senate.\n- House Speaker Mike Johnson could only afford one GOP dissent following a recent special election victory for Democrat Christian Menefee.\n- The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced a delay for the January jobs report until after reopening.\n- Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has mandated body cameras for officers in Minneapolis.\n\n**White House Announces Critical Minerals Project**\nPresident Trump on Monday declared the launch of \"Project Vault,\" an initiative to build a $12 billion stockpile of critical minerals essential for technologies such as electric vehicles and defense systems. The project will use $1.67 billion from private investment and a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Trump drew parallels to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, stating this initiative aims to ensure availability during emergencies.\n- Project Vault will help counter China's dominance in critical mineral supply chains.\n- U.S. imports over 50% of 29 critical minerals and remains utterly dependent on imports for a dozen more.\n- Notable companies involved in the project include Google, General Motors, and Boeing.\n\n**IDF Believes Gaza Death Count Is Accurate**\nA senior IDF official acknowledged approximately 70,000 deaths in Gaza during the conflict, aligning with Hamas-run health ministry reports of 71,667 fatalities.
