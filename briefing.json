    "mainText": "**Today’s Briefing**\n**The Board of Peace Meets in Washington**\nPresident Donald Trump hosted world leaders in Washington, D.C. for the first meeting of the Board of Peace, an international panel established to oversee reconstruction efforts in Gaza and other projects. Nine member nations contributed a combined $7 billion towards a Gaza reconstruction fund, with the U.S. pledging $10 billion, though Trump did not specify the funding source. He indicated a preference for avoiding military force against Hamas, stating he believed the group might voluntarily disarm. Five countries—Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, and Morocco—pledged to deploy a peacekeeping force to Gaza for the reconstruction initiative. Egypt and Jordan committed to training new Gaza police officers. Nickolay Mladenov, the board’s high representative for Gaza and former U.N. envoy, reported that the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza had received 2,000 applications to serve in the police force.\n\nFIFA has pledged $50 million for building a soccer stadium in Gaza, along with an additional $15 million for a FIFA academy. Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov had planned to attend the meeting, but the U.S. government did not issue the necessary visas for his delegation.\n\n**Trump Mulls Action Against Iran**\nDuring the Board of Peace meeting, Trump indicated he would decide on potential military action against Iran within ten days. CBS News reported that U.S. forces are prepared to act as early as this weekend, though no commitment has been made. He hinted at a possible deal with Iran but warned of severe consequences should negotiations fail. International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi stated that while progress was made during his recent meeting with Iranian officials, much work remains, and he emphasized the urgency of the situation due to Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium. The Iranian government warned U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres of its readiness to take decisive actions in response to potential attacks, identifying U.S. military bases in the Middle East as possible targets. However, the BBC noted the U.K. had not granted the U.S. permission to use its military bases for a strike against Iran.\n\n**Little Hope for Russia-Ukraine Peace Deal**\nEuropean intelligence officials conveyed to Reuters that a Ukraine-Russia peace agreement seems unlikely this year. Four of five officials indicated that the Kremlin is leveraging negotiations to gain sanctions relief and favorable business opportunities. The IMF announced it would review a staff-level agreement for an $8.1 billion lending program for Ukraine as Ukraine completed necessary preconditions, including adopting a new budget.\n\nRussian forces attacked Ukrainian areas on Thursday, with reports of at least nine civilian injuries. Concurrently, Ukrainian drones targeted the Crimea port city of Sevastopol, yielding one fatality. Sweden has introduced a significant defense aid package for Ukraine worth more than $1.4 billion.\n\n**Venezuela Passes Amnesty Bill**\nVenezuela’s legislature recently passed an amnesty bill, signed into law by acting President Delcy Rodríguez, aimed at freeing political prisoners detained by prior regimes. This legislation excludes those accused of military rebellion during the 2019 anti-regime protests and does not provide restitution for seized assets. Human rights groups assert that over 600 individuals remain detained for political reasons, while 448 prisoners have been released since January.\n\n**New York Redistricting Map Goes to Supreme Court**\nIn a significant development, two groups of New Yorkers and Democratic officials urged the Supreme Court not to intervene with a ruling by New York Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey Pearlman, which demanded a redraw of the congressional map before the 2026 midterm elections. Pearlman’s order aimed to rectify the dilution of voting power for black and Latino residents within the state's congressional representation.\n\n**Implications of Hungary’s Upcoming Election**\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, expressing U.S. support for Hungary's political stability ahead of the April elections. Orbán is facing a stiff challenge from conservative Péter Magyar and his center-right Tisza party, with polls showing mixed r",
