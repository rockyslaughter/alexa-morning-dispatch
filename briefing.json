    "mainText": "**Takaichi Wins Super Majority in Snap Election**\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) achieved a significant victory in a snap election held on Sunday, securing 316 out of the 465 seats in the lower house. This marks the first time a single party has achieved a two-thirds supermajority in Japan's House of Representatives since World War II. The LDP's coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, won an additional 36 seats. Takaichi, who took office in October 2025, called for the snap election last month as part of her strategy to bolster her party's legislative power.\n\nThe LDP's historic win gives them the capacity to override decisions made by Japan's upper chamber, enhancing Takaichi's ability to advance her agenda significantly. This election was notably characterized by strong personal appeal rather than distinct policy differences among parties.\n\n**Market Response**\nIn reaction to the election results, the Nikkei 225, Japan's stock index, surged by over five percent on Monday, briefly exceeding its all-time high. Takaichi has received public praise from President Donald Trump, who endorsed her party ahead of the election.\n\n**Bombing in Pakistan**\nIn a tragic incident, a terrorist attack in Islamabad, Pakistan, resulted in the deaths of at least 31 people on Friday. The assailant entered a Shiite mosque, opened fire, and detonated a bomb, which also left over 170 individuals injured. This marks the deadliest attack in the city since 2008. The Islamic State's affiliate in Pakistan later claimed responsibility for the attack. The Pakistani Interior Minister indicated that the attackers viewed civilian Shiite Muslims as potential recruits for Shiite militias battling the Islamic State in Syria.\n\nFollowing the attack, Pakistani authorities arrested four individuals, including the suspected mastermind, believed to be an Islamic State operative linked to a larger network based in Afghanistan. The Chinese government condemned the attack and expressed readiness to support Pakistan's efforts to maintain security.\n\n**Iran Negotiation Updates**\nPresident Trump announced progress in U.S.-Iran negotiations that took place in Oman, aimed at halting Iran's nuclear weapons program and preventing military conflict. The discussions, which lasted about eight hours, were described positively by both U.S. and Iranian officials. Nevertheless, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that the nation would not accept any compromises on its enrichment levels, asserting that dismantling nuclear programs is not an option.\n\nU.S. and Iran representatives agreed to indirect follow-up discussions, with Araghchi indicating that Iran was prepared to respond aggressively if the U.S. chose to attack Iranian forces in the Middle East.\n\n**Ukraine Peace Deal Updates**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shared that the Trump administration is pushing for a Ukraine-Russia peace agreement by June. Recent talks involved U.S., Ukrainian, and Russian representatives in Abu Dhabi, highlighting Russia's ongoing demand for control of the eastern Donbas region, which Zelensky firmly declared non-negotiable. Meanwhile, Russia has intensified military attacks, deploying over 100 drones targeting residential and industrial areas in Ukraine.\n\n**Uber Found Liable for Rape**\nIn a landmark case, a federal jury in Arizona ruled that Uber is liable for the rape of a passenger by one of its drivers and must pay $8.5 million in damages. Plaintiffs argued that Uber's safety measures were lacking, despite the company's promotion of safe rides. Although they sought $144 million, the jury did not find Uber liable for negligence related to customer safety or any alleged defects in its app.\n\nA spokesperson for Uber stated the company is committed to rider safety and plans to appeal the decision.",
