    "mainText": "**Russian War Leader Shot In Moscow**\nLt. Gen. Vladimir Alekseyev, the deputy chief of Russia’s military intelligence division, has been shot this morning and is now hospitalized. Russian authorities report that he was shot in the back of his apartment building. Independent sources suggest the shooting occurred in the elevator lobby at approximately 7 a.m. local time, and Alekseyev is currently in critical condition. He was previously sanctioned by the United States in 2016 for cyber operations linked to that year's presidential election and again by the European Union in 2019 for his involvement in the poisoning of spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England. Alekseyev has been associated with Russia’s volunteer and mercenary groups, including the Wagner Group. Since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a total of 19 Russian generals have reportedly been killed.\n\n**Iran Talks Begin**\nU.S. and Iranian officials are set to meet in Oman later today for talks regarding Iran’s nuclear program, including its support for paramilitary groups and missile development. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Donald Trump’s strategy prioritizes diplomacy but retains other options. She emphasized that the administration still demands Iran reduce its nuclear capacity to zero. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has indicated he is actively pursuing a diplomatic resolution between the U.S. and Iran. Recent tensions have escalated, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seizing two oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, detaining 15 foreign crew members. Ezzatollah Zarghami, a former Iranian minister, stated that Iran would turn the Strait of Hormuz into a “place of massacre and hell for the U.S.” In response, the U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran issued a security alert advising American citizens in the country to leave immediately.\n\n**Trump Launches Drug Discount Website**\nPresident Trump has launched an online drug discount platform named TrumpRx, aimed at helping consumers purchase certain medications directly from manufacturers, with 43 medications currently listed. Trump claimed that under the agreements for this site, drugs would be available to Americans at the lowest prices in the world. However, many of the listed drugs are covered by insurance, leaving uncertainty regarding actual savings. The Trump administration has secured deals with at least 16 drug manufacturers to offer discounted medications.\nRecently, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services head Mehmet Oz urged Congress to codify most-favored-nation pricing for drugs.\n\n**Venezuela Passes Amnesty Bill**\nVenezuela’s legislature has unanimously advanced an amnesty law meant to grant clemency to individuals detained for anti-government demonstrations. The bill requires public consultation before it can undergo further parliamentary votes. However, those imprisoned for serious crimes related to death or severe harm will not qualify for amnesty. Reports indicate that beneficiaries of the bill will have state-seized assets returned to them. Opposition leader María Corina Machado indicated the potential for new democratic elections in Venezuela within a year but noted she is yet to discuss this with Trump.\n\n**ICE Expands Detention Amid Funding Standoff**\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune stated that serious negotiations over funding for the Department of Homeland Security have not yet begun. Reports indicate that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is considering acquiring large warehouses in 20 locations to serve as migrant detention facilities, having already secured contracts for three locations that could hold a combined total of up to 8,000 detainees. Meanwhile, the Justice Department has detained a Minnesota activist accused of encouraging violence against federal immigration officials and has secured a temporary injunction barring ICE from detaining suspected illegal immigrants in Oregon without a warrant.",
