    "mainText": "**Inside The TikTok Deal**\n\nIn spring 2024, bipartisan support emerged over concerns about TikTok, a social media platform owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. Lawmakers passed legislation to prohibit its operation in the U.S. unless ByteDance divested its ownership, giving the company a 270-day deadline to comply.\n\nAs the deadline approached on January 19, 2025, no divestiture agreement was in place. The Supreme Court upheld the ban, leading TikTok to go offline in the U.S. for 14 hours until then-President-elect Donald Trump announced, \"We have to save it.\" President Joe Biden, who signed the original bill, chose not to enforce the ban on his last day in office. Trump subsequently issued an executive order delaying enforcement for an additional 90 days. This has since been extended multiple times, with Trump’s administration creating plans to maintain TikTok's operation while addressing national security concerns.\n\nIn early January 2026, ByteDance reached a deal to transfer control of its U.S. operations to a new American-led joint venture while retaining a small stake, slightly under Congress's 20 percent limit.\n\nUnder this deal, a consortium of investors, including American firms and a group led by Oracle, Silver Lake, and a UAE investment firm, will manage the new TikTok. The consortium is responsible for safeguarding user data and ensuring that the app's controversial recommendation algorithm—previously linked to ByteDance—is monitored for potential biases favoring Chinese interests.\n\nExperts suggest the structure may alleviate concerns over foreign influence, as it limits direct control by ByteDance. However, questions remain regarding the extent to which the algorithm can be separated from ByteDance's influence, as its software may still be Chinese-engineered. Adam Presser, former head of TikTok's operations, will lead this new venture.\n\n---\n\n**Quick Hits: Today’s Top Stories**\n\n1. **Trump Reportedly Considers Large-Scale Air Assault on Iran**\nCNN reported that President Trump is contemplating airstrikes against Iranian leaders.
